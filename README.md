This implementation of a transmission spectroscopy experiment is based on the paper "Robust Gaussian Process Regression with Huber Likelihood." 
It modifies the code provided by Gibson et al. (2012), which introduces the use of a Huber likelihood function to effectively model observed data, including measurements from the first orbit.
